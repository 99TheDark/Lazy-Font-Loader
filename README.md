# Lazy-Font-Loader
Just messing around with font-face to see if there is an easy way on the user to load Google fonts.

Simply add `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/99TheDark/Lazy-Font-Loader@v1.0.0/main.js"></script>` to your head. Then you can use the `loadFont` function.

This will likely be ported to my library, Dark.js.
